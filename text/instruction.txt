<strong> How To Play</strong>
<br>
Pick a format from the box below and hit the Generate! button.
<br> <br>
A random Pokémon from that is in that tier will be generated (kinda... see the clarifications for more details).
<br> <br>
Once the target is generated, enter the name of a Pokémon to make your guess.
<br> <br> <br>
<strong> Interpreting Guess Results</strong>
<br>
You will be shown that Pokémon's most recent usage statistics, types, base stat total and highest stat.
<br> <br>
The box for each will be green if you got it correct, yellow if it is partially correct and white otherwise.
<br> <br>
Usaage statistics will be yellow if you are within a 5% range (2.5% above and below) of the target's usage.
<br> <br>
Base stat total will be yellow if you are within a 50 point range.
<br> <br>
Usage stats and base stat total will also have an arrow indicating if your guess is greater than or less than the target.
<br> <br>
Types will be yellow if you have the right type but in the wrong order.
<br>
For example, if your guess was Great Tusk (ground/fighting) and the target is Quagsire (water/ground), ground would be yellow and fighting would be white.
<br> <br>
Highest stat will only be white or green.
<br>
If a Pokémon has multiple highest stats, it will pick the first in the order of hp, atk, def, sp. atk, sp. def and speed.
