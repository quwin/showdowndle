<strong>Usage Stats Can Be Slow To Update</strong>
<br>
All data is based off of the most recent usage data, which is usually data from the previous month.
<br>
If it's just a few days into the current month, the data might not have updated yet and be from two months ago.
<br> <br>
Because of this, if a Pokémon has recently been banned from a tier (less than a month ago), it may still show
up as the target.
<br> <br>
Also, Pokémon that fell to a tier in the latest tier shifts cannot be chosen as the target, but will still have their
most recent usage data show up if you try to guess them.
<br> <br> <br>
<strong>The Target May Not <i>Technically</i> Be in the Tier</strong>
<br>
For a Pokémon to be in a tier, it must have an average of >4.52% usage in the last 3 month tiering period, those being
Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec, in the 1630+ ladder (1695+ for gen9ou).
<br> <br>
However, I have found some scenarios in which a Pokémon has met the usage threshold and not been included in the tier.
<br> <br>
For example, Raikou consistently had >6% usage in the 1630+ ladder for gen3ou from Jul-Sep of 2025.
<br> <br>
However, it is was ranked UUBL as of December 2025, even though Cloyster was ranked OU and did not reach the >4.52% average usage threshold.
<br> <br>
This is probably just a mistake on my part, so feel free to check the credits to see how you can send me a message telling me
I'm an idiot.
<br> <br> <br>
<strong>Returned Types and BST Are the Most Recent Values</strong>
<br>
If you've chosen gen3ou, you may find that Clefable is listed as a mono-fairy type, or Swellow has a bst of 455
when it should be 430.
<br> <br>
This issue is mostly just cause I'm lazy. I might go back and fix this (no promises though).
